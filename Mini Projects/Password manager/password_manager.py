#python file opening modes ig 
#w is "write" create or orveride a file
#r "read mode" reads a file 
#a "apend mode" allows you to add to the end of a file or create a new file if it does not exist if it does you can write and read it
#rb "read/bites mode" read bits or sum idk thats what the guy said
